  title = {Sensorless Robot Collision Detection and Hybrid Force/Motion Control},
  author = {De Luca, A. and Mattone, R.},
  booktitle = {ICRA},
  year = {2005},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of real-time detection of collisions between a robot manipulator and obstacles of unknown geometry and location in the environment without the use of extra sensors. The idea is to handle a collision at a generic point along the robot as a fault of its actuating system. A previously developed dynamic FDI (fault detection and isolation) technique is used, which does not require acceleration or force measurements. The actual robot link that has collided can also be identified. Once contact has been detected, it is possible to switch to a suitably defined hybrid force/motion controller that enables to keep the contact, while sliding on the obstacle, and to regulate the interaction force. Simulation results are shown for a two-link planar robot.},

  author = {De Luca, A. and Mattone, R.},
  booktitle = {ICRA},
  year = {2004},

  abstract = {An adaptive scheme is presented for actuator fault detection and isolation (FDI) in robotic systems, based on the use of generalized momenta and of a suitable overparametrization of the uncertain robot dynamics. This allows to obtain an accurate and reliable detection and isolation of possibly concurrent faults also during the parameter adaptation phase. Experimental results are reported for a planar robot under gravity, considering partial, total, or bias-type failures of the motor torques.},

The FDI scheme does not need acceleration estimates or simulation of the nominal robot dynamics and covers a general class of input faults. Numerical results for a 2R robot undergoing also concurrent actuator faults are reported. This method is extended to robots with joint elasticity and to the inclusion of actuator dynamics.},
